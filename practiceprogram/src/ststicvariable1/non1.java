/**
Varibale declared outside the method body but present inside the class body knowns global variable
if its declared without static keyword dn it will known as nonstatic global variable

NSGV:
	* always declared without static keyword
	* are also known as instance/object variable
	* because they are loaded in the memory at the time of execution when object is created
	* to access non-static member, first we need load them into the memory by creating an instance/object
		Syntax to create an object:(will be created in the Heap memory which is a rando storage area)
					classname referenceVariable; // object declaration
					referenceVariable = new classname();//object initiliazation
							//or
					classname referenceVariable = new classname();

					referenceVariable.nonstaticMember
			
	* NSGV we will multiple copies in the memory allocation depending on objecting
	* if we declared any global variable but not initiliazed then java compiler will
	  initiliaze its value based on the datatype
